To run this on your Desktop you need Laravel as the Laravel's vendor folder is missing in this repository. Download Laravel using composer and create a project then extract & replace all the files and folder from the clone zip to that project directory you have created. Make sure Xampp and PHPMyAdmin is running on your Computer. import clothing.sql database in PHPMyAdmin and then run the project.
